 A simple plug-and-play-adapter (papa) using node.js and socket.io to add realtime functionality to an existing application through a subscription to a shared Redis instance.

 Realtime papa is designed to be deployed as a standalone application that can be used in conjunction with any existing application that already uses Redis.

 ## Getting Started

 ```
 git clone git@github.com:kylesuss/realtime-papa.git
 npm install
 ```
